        Recent implementation of Ractor#select waits for the readiness of input ractors
        in order. So, in may cases, it leads to deterministic starvation such that
        the second to last ractors in the input array never have a chance to be taken.
        For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nr1 = Ractor.new do\r\n  loop do\r\n    sleep
        1\r\n    Ractor.yield ''From r1''\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nr2 = Ractor.new do\r\n  loop
        do\r\n    sleep 1\r\n    Ractor.yield ''From r2''\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nre
        = Ractor.new(Ractor.current) do |r|\r\n  loop do\r\n    sleep 1\r\n    r.send
        ''To Main''\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nloop do\r\n  sleep 2\r\n  r, message =
        Ractor.select(r1, r2, Ractor.current, yield_value: ''yielded'')\r\n  puts
        \"#{r}: #{message}\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs r1''s outgoing queue always has
        at least 1 item in its outgoing port, Ractor#select always return message
        from r1. The rest are not touch, and blocked forever.\r\n\r\nThe solution
        is to shuffle the actions array before processing it in `ractor_select`. After
        this change, if many ractors are ready, a random ractor is picked out from
        the arrray.\r\n\r\n- Fix a bug when I use Reactor#select on a closed ractor.
        Consider this use case:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nr = Ractor.new do\r\n  3.times do
        |index|\r\n    Ractor.yield index\r\n  end\r\n  ''end''\r\nend\r\n\r\nresult
        = []\r\nbegin\r\n  loop do\r\n    _r, message = Ractor.select(r)\r\n    result
        << message\r\n  end\r\n  puts ''Not reachable'' # This line is not supposed
        to be reached\r\nrescue Ractor::ClosedError => e\r\n  puts result.inspect\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter
        the ractor is closed, it should raises Ractor::ClosedError. In fact, it exits
        the wrapping loop and jumps to `Not reachable` line instead. \r\n\r\n- Fix
        a bug that `Ractor#recv` can be called from other ractor with `__send__`.\r\n\r\n-
        Question: In the scenario that multiple ractors are taking from a same ractor,
        the current implementation is first-come-first-serve. The following example
        prints r1 -> r2 -> r1 -> r2 -> ... in order. Is it intentional, or should
        I shuffle the waiting list when adding a new waiting ractor too?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nR
        = Ractor.current\r\n\r\nr1 = Ractor.new do\r\n  loop do\r\n    R.take\r\n    puts
        ''r1''\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nr2 = Ractor.new do\r\n  loop do\r\n    R.take\r\n    puts

        PR adds support for automatic GC compaction on major collections.\r\n\r\n`GC.enable_autocompact`
        enables the feature and `GC.disable_autocompact` disables the feature.  The
        feature is *disabled* by default.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes _object movement_
        happen at the same time as page sweep.  When one page finishes sweeping, that
        page is filled.\r\n\r\n## Sweep + Move Phase\r\n\r\nDuring sweep, we keep
        a pointer to the current sweeping page.  This pointer is kept in [`heap->sweeping_page`](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L4817).  At
        the beginning of sweep, this is the *first* element of the heap''s linked
        list.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the compaction process points at the *last*
        page in the heap, and that is stored in `heap->compact_cursor` [here](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L5023).\r\n\r\nIncremental
        sweeping sweeps one page at a time in the [`gc_page_sweep` function](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L4624).  At
        the end of that function, we call [`gc_fill_swept_page`](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L4738-L4742).  `gc_fill_swept_page`
        fills the page that was just swept and moves the movement cursor towards the
        sweeping cursor.\r\n\r\nWhen the sweeping cursor and the movement cursor meet,
        sweeping is paused, and references are updated.  This can happen in 2 ways,
        the sweeping cursor \"runs in to the moving cursor\" which is [here](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L4634-L4644).  Or
        the moving cursor runs in to the sweep cursor which happens [here](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L4425-L4430).\r\n\r\nEither
        way, the sweep step is paused and references are updated.\r\n\r\n## Reference
        Updating\r\n\r\nReference updating hasn''t changed, but since reference updating
        happens before the GC finishes a cycle, it must take in to account garbage
        objects [here](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L8971-L8977).\r\n\r\n##
        Read Barrier\r\n\r\nDuring the sweep phase, some objects may touch other objects.  For
        example, `T_CLASS` [must remove itself from a parent class](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L2769-L2770).\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass
        A; end\r\nclass B < A; end\r\n\r\nconst_set(:B, nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `B`
        is freed, it must remove itself from `A`''s subclasses.  But what if `A` moved?  To
        fix this, I''ve introduced a read barrier.  The read barrier protects `heap_page_body`
        using `mprotect`.  If something tries to read from the page, an exception
        will occur and we can move all objects back to the page (invalidate the movement).\r\n\r\nThe
        lock function is [here](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L4321-L4335).\r\nThe
        unlock function is [here](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L4337-L4351).\r\n\r\nIt
        uses `sigaction` to catch the exception [here](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L4514-L4530).\r\n\r\n##
        Cross Platform\r\n\r\n`mprotect` and `sigaction` are not cross platform, they
        doesn''t work on Windows. On Windows the read barrier uses exception handlers
        that are built in to Windows.  I implemented them [here](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/8a4d8fa0ea463d44486bf2447ea9830593768fd7/gc.c#L4471-L4503).\r\n\r\nThe

        we force recycle an object before the page is swept, we should clear it in
        the mark bitmap. We should clear it in the bitmap before we sweep the page
        (rather than after we sweep the page) because after we sweep the page the
        object is only marked if it is uncollectable (i.e. old object). If we don''t
        clear it in the bitmap, then during sweeping we won''t account for this free
        slot so the `free_slots` count of the page will be incorrect. (This is the
        first commit).\r\n\r\nBut then I noticed that we are clearing the marking
        and mark bits in almost every case (and it does not do any harm when we clear
        a bit that is not set), so we can simplify this function. (This is the second

        added test case crashes the interpreter because it makes\r\nObjectSpace.internal_class_of
        return the second VALUE slot of an AST\r\nimemo object. The second VALUE slot
        of `struct rb_ast_struct` is\r\nnot a VALUE and not a pointer to a Ruby object.\r\n\r\n---\r\nHere

        I think\r\nwhat''s happening in those cases is that `ObjectSpace.internal_class_of`

        land.\r\n\r\nA way to fix this this crash without make a breaking change is
        to make sure the second\r\n`VALUE` slot of all the objects on the heap always
        store a valid object. I\r\nthink the freedom to put whatever we want there
        is more valuable than making\r\nthis niche API more useful, though.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-02T03:39:11Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T03:40:22Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54e325b94b3d45bd1866e83d0b5ebbb254902465","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ko1","id":9558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ko1","html_url":"https://github.com/ko1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ko1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ko1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ko1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ko1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ko1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ko1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ko1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ko1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ko1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/pulls/3503/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/pulls/3503/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/issues/3503/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/statuses/d8504bd2aa2b820effbbc33ea668b4ba9f4cfb6e","head":{"label":"XrXr:internal-class-crash","ref":"internal-class-crash","sha":"d8504bd2aa2b820effbbc33ea668b4ba9f4cfb6e","user":{"login":"XrXr","id":6457510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTc1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6457510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr","html_url":"https://github.com/XrXr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":155087569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTUwODc1Njk=","name":"ruby","full_name":"XrXr/ruby","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XrXr","id":6457510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTc1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6457510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr","html_url":"https://github.com/XrXr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XrXr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XrXr/ruby","description":"The

        current prelude code structs do not have space for a null terminating character.
        This means that the Ruby string generated in `PRELUDE_CODE` points to a string
        that potentially does not have a null terminator (even if it does, it''s out
        of bounds). This string is used to build the ast using `PRELUDE_AST` and `rb_builtin_ast`.\r\n\r\nFor
        example:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```c\r\nstatic const char prelude_name0[] = \"<internal:ast>\";\r\nstatic
        const struct {\r\n    char L0[507]; /* 1..106 */\r\n    char L106[361]; /*
        107..147 */\r\n} prelude_code0 = {\r\n#line 1 \"ast.rb\"\r\n\"class RubyVM\\n\"\r\n...\r\n\"end\\n\"\r\n#line
        607 \"miniprelude.c\"\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```c\r\nstatic const char
        prelude_name0[] = \"<internal:ast>\";\r\nstatic const struct {\r\n    char
        L0[507]; /* 1..106 */\r\n    char L106[362]; /* 107..147 */\r\n} prelude_code0
        = {\r\n#line 1 \"ast.rb\"\r\n\"class RubyVM\\n\"\r\n...\r\n\"end\\n\\0\"\r\n#line
        607 \"miniprelude.c\"\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new `prelude_code0` struct is
        larger by a byte to store the null terminator.","created_at":"2020-08-31T13:51:39Z","updated_at":"2020-09-01T00:52:49Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ed33871c6aef389e6e87a0d17979a2cf670c98b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/pulls/3482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/pulls/3482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/issues/3482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/statuses/11cbca1ab6bf076c2957a262944a0bc152b14b0b","head":{"label":"Shopify:pz-fix-prelude-str","ref":"pz-fix-prelude-str","sha":"11cbca1ab6bf076c2957a262944a0bc152b14b0b","user":{"login":"Shopify","id":8085,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjgwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify","html_url":"https://github.com/Shopify","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211281703,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODE3MDM=","name":"ruby","full_name":"Shopify/ruby","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Shopify","id":8085,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjgwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify","html_url":"https://github.com/Shopify","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shopify/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Shopify/ruby","description":"The

        issue - https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17056\r\n\r\nI have also usecases
        for this, like in `rubocop`s codebase sometimes we need to find `start index`
        and `end index` of some AST node in the stream of tokens. It is pointless
        to start searching from the beginning for `end index` when we already found
        a `start index`, so we can provide offset index to the `Array#index` method.\r\n\r\nI
        don''t know how to (better) implement `array(offset) { |item| ... }`. As in
        the original code this will generate a warning, skip the block and use an
        `offset` argument as a searched `obj`.\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution
        - sorry, if I made some dumb mistakes.","created_at":"2020-08-23T14:18:07Z","updated_at":"2020-08-23T14:18:07Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ed05e310e46e2cd87d507d5514b9895201f1171","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/pulls/3448/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/pulls/3448/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/issues/3448/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/statuses/7e0f4758adfcbaec2dc6f9adb373cde6ad68ab58","head":{"label":"fatkodima:array_index-with-start-position","ref":"array_index-with-start-position","sha":"7e0f4758adfcbaec2dc6f9adb373cde6ad68ab58","user":{"login":"fatkodima","id":5657035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTcwMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5657035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima","html_url":"https://github.com/fatkodima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":289697076,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODk2OTcwNzY=","name":"ruby","full_name":"fatkodima/ruby","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fatkodima","id":5657035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTcwMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5657035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima","html_url":"https://github.com/fatkodima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fatkodima/ruby","description":"The
